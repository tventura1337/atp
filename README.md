# Air Travel Planner
## Description
Air Travel Planner (ATP) is an application designed to calculate the optimal flight path between two airports. For our models, we focus on direct flights and one-stop layover flights. Using historic airline cost data, and cancellation and delay patterns, we formulate a Markov Decision Problem (MDP) and perform value iteration to calculate the best solution.
